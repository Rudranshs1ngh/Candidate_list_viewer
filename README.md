# Candidate_list_viewer
Building a Candidate List Viewer:
Using React to create a page that displays a list of candidates with mock data fetched from an API.
Each candidate should have the following fields: Name, Skills, and Years of Experience.
Backend API:
Using Node.js/Express to create a single API endpoint (/api/candidates) that serves a hardcoded list of 10 candidate objects.
The data can be static (no need for a database).
Frontend Requirements:
Fetch data from the API and display it in a table format.
Add a search bar to filter candidates by Name or Skills.
Bonus Points:
Add a simple sorting feature to order candidates by Years of Experience.
