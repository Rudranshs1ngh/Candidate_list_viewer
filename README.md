# Candidate_list_viewer
Build a Candidate List Viewer:
Using React to create a page that displays a list of candidates with mock data fetched from an API.
Each candidate has the following fields: Name, Skills, and Years of Experience.
Backend API:
Used Node.js/Express to create a single API endpoint (/api/candidates) that serves a hardcoded list of 10 candidate objects.
The data is static (no need for a database).
Frontend:
Fetching  data from the API and displaying it in a table format.
Adding a search bar to filter candidates by Name or Skills.

Also Added a simple sorting feature to order candidates by Years of Experience.
